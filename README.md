# Book-Recommendation-System
A book recommendation system where users can rate books and have books recommended to them based on ones they have already read and their previous ratings. 
I created this project in my final year of high school as part of a culminating assignment for my computer science course. The software has multiple pages created using using object-oriented programming and Java Applet.
